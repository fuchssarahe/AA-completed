**Content: **code of conduct+course expectations, practice assessment, basic enumerable methods, first go at pair programming

**Observations:**

**Code of Conduct:** Basics! Good stuff. From the perspective of a woman who has always worked/learned in a male-dominated technical field, however, the heavily sexual slant of the presentation was somewhat off-putting. I’m not sure if it is simply a reactionary response to previous issues, but it is always nice to see people being held to a higher standard, regardless.

**Practice Assessment:** Based on the setup process for the practice assessment, it should actually be fairly easy to continue developing on a Windows machine. Moving forward, I think I will indeed continue to use my windows pc, though I do think setting up a spare laptop with a windows environment will be helpful as a intermediate step if necessary. I’m confident there are resources out there for windows, but it will probably take a little time and research to make it work.

With an approximate 5-15% failure rate on assessments, I’m definitely nervous about failing too many. As a slow coder, I’m certainly going to fall behind my peers. You get faster by practicing, and I’m scared that I won’t have enough time to get through what I need to in order to avoid getting kicked out of the course. 

**Enumerables:** Also, basics and good stuff! These were a great refresher to dig back into content after a brief respite from the prep-work. 

**Pair Programming Initial Impressions:** Pair programming was a treat! It was great to work with Ki-Ye, as she is clearly and bright and motivated individual. Though I don’t ordinarily work well with other women (too much people-pleasing for decisive action), I think we struck a good balance today. We certainly got through more work than I could have done on my own, so it was definitely a positive first experience.
